yeah add entropion armor it should have 110 def for head and same for the leggings 
and 130 def for the chestplate
overall damage increase for this set should be lower than the luminant but its for melee only
and 10% DR for each piece for this and a 10% for the set bonus
also set bonus:
everytime you hit enemies with a melee weapon dmg increases by 5%
caps at 60%
this decreases when using other classes or overtime not attacking(decreases around 20 seconds when not attacking)


also entropion wings are as fast as the celestial starboard but not faster then the wrings

also the sword should be like the entropion blade murasama type attack
but it charges like the gae sword first and then swings
the sword should be the almost the same damage as the entropion blade
and the name for the sword should be judgement of azathoth

luminant armor or forestcalls armor(forestcall is a rival god in funi lore), redesign and concept

General idea: very late game generalist armor set, heavily rewards the player for avoiding attacks, and heavily punishes for getting hit


Luminant Headgear
40 defense
8% DR
35% damage increase

Luminant breast plate
55 defense
20% damage increase
30% crit chance 
Crits deal 10% more damage

Luminant leggings
35 defense 
10% damage increase 
25% faster attack speed
40% faster speed

Set bonus 
+6 minions
All attacks fire a Light bolt
Gives the buff “don’t get hit dumbass” which gives 75% damage increase, but upon taking damage, the buff is replaced with the “dumbass” debuff, which reduces horizontal speed, and damage by 85%
